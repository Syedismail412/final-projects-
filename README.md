# HR Employee Attrition Analysis

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and builds a machine learning model to understand and predict employee attrition using the **HR Employee Attrition** dataset.

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal is to identify the key factors that contribute to employee attrition and use those insights to build a predictive model. The analysis includes:

- Data cleaning and inspection
- Univariate and bivariate visualizations
- Numerical feature analysis
- Random Forest Classifier for prediction

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## 🧾 Dataset

The dataset used is `HR-Employee-Attrition.csv`, which contains information about employees, including personal, professional, and salary-related features. The target variable is `Attrition` (Yes/No).

## 📈 EDA Highlights

- Countplots to analyze categorical variables like `BusinessTravel`, `Gender`, `OverTime`, etc.
- Histograms to study the distribution of numerical variables like `MonthlyIncome`, `DistanceFromHome`, etc.
- Correlation between features and employee attrition.

## 🤖 Model Building

- **Algorithm used:** Random Forest Classifier
- **Preprocessing:** Label encoding for the target, one-hot encoding for categorical features
- **Train/Test Split:** 80/20 ratio
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Confusion Matrix, Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

## 📝 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hr-employee-attrition.git
   cd hr-employee-attrition

# 🏥 Medical Appointment No-Show Analysis

This project analyzes the **KaggleV2-May-2016** dataset to explore patterns and factors that influence whether patients show up for their scheduled medical appointments.

## 📘 Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to understand what factors might influence a patient’s decision to **miss or attend** a medical appointment. This is achieved through:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature relationship visualizations (e.g., age, gender, medical history)

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source:** Kaggle — [Medical Appointment No Shows](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments)
- **Observations:** 110,527
- **Features:** 14 including `Age`, `Gender`, `No_show`, `Hypertension`, `Diabetes`, `SMS_received`, etc.

The target variable is **`No-show`**, which indicates whether a patient showed up for their appointment (`No`) or not (`Yes`).

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python 3
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 🔍 Key Steps

### ✅ Data Cleaning
- Removed irrelevant columns: `PatientId`, `AppointmentID`, `ScheduledDay`, `AppointmentDay`
- Removed duplicated rows
- Fixed column names (`Hipertension` → `Hypertension`, `No-show` → `No_show`)
- Removed invalid age values (e.g., Age = -1)

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Histograms of numerical features
- Show vs No-show counts
- Age distributions by attendance status
- Mean age comparisons by medical condition (`Hypertension`, `Diabetes`)
- Gender-based attendance insights

### 📈 Visual Insights
- Patients with **hypertension and diabetes** tend to have higher mean ages.
- Attendance appears influenced by age and gender.
- More patients show up than those who miss appointments, but patterns vary across demographics.

## 📌 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/no-show-appointments.git
   cd no-show-appointments
